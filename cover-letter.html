            <p>Dear Hiring Manager,</p>

            <p>
              I am writing to
              <em
                >express my interest in the Penetration Tester position at your
                company </em
              >. With over <mark>5 years of experience</mark> in cybersecurity,
              specifically in penetration testing, I have gained expertise in
              identifying vulnerabilities, conducting in-depth security
              assessments, and providing actionable recommendations to mitigate
              risks. My background in ethical hacking, coupled with hands-on
              experience in both manual and automated testing, has equipped me
              with the necessary skills to excel in this role.
            </p>

            <p>
              In my current role at Expression, Inc., I conduct comprehensive
              black-box, white-box, and gray-box penetration tests on
              <mark>networks, web applications, and APIs</mark>. During these
              assessments, I have successfully identified critical
              vulnerabilities such as
              <strong
                >SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and privilege
                escalation flaws</strong
              >. My ability to collaborate with development and security teams
              to implement remediation steps has contributed to strengthening
              our organization’s overall security posture.
            </p>

            <p>
              In addition to my practical experience, I hold certifications such
              as
              <strong>
                Offensive Security Certified Professional (OSCP), eLearnSecurity
                Junior Penetration Tester (eJPT), and CompTIA Security+ </strong
              >, further demonstrating my commitment to maintaining a high
              standard of technical proficiency and ethical responsibility in
              the cybersecurity field.
            </p>

            <p>
              What excites me most about this opportunity is your company's
              focus on innovation and proactive security measures. I am
              confident that
              <strong>
                my skills in penetration testing, vulnerability scanning, and
                risk management
              </strong>
              will contribute to the continued success of your security team. I
              am eager to bring
              <mark
                >my expertise in ethical hacking and security assessments to
                your organization and help mitigate potential threats before
                they can be exploited.</mark
              >
            </p>

            <p>
              Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the
